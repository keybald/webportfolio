## Purpose

The screenshots demonstrate what I achieved with Django, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap on an amateur level. The portfolio consits of: 

1. FoodieTruck1.png, FoodieTruck2.png and FoodieTruck3. A website for ordering food. I haven't had a chance to implement more advanced features such as looking for a restaurant, placing an order, etc.
2. Google.png. I created this page without looking at Google's code.
3. Right-o-move1.png and Right-o-move2.png. Django website that has the ability to search for houses to buy based on various specifications, such as size, cost, or location.

I can share the source code on request, because I would need to sanitize the files before uploading these onto GitHub, and this would take a lot of time.
